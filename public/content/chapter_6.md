### Chapter 6: Buzzard Patrol

Monday morning, before the store opened, Gabe slipped through the employee entrance with his backpack weighing heavy on his shoulders. Inside, wrapped in anti-static bags and foam, was what he'd started calling the "sensor pack"—a collection of tiny wireless modules he'd assembled over the weekend. Each one no bigger than a quarter, running on button batteries that would last weeks if he managed the polling intervals right. Cleo had been insistent about expanding her awareness beyond the basement, and after days of her subtle requests becoming less subtle demands, he'd finally given in.

The warehouse was empty except for the overnight crew finishing their shift, too tired to pay attention to one more tech employee heading to his workstation. Gabe made his way to aisle 16, his usual haunt for GPU testing and repairs. He'd chosen this spot carefully—far from the main traffic areas but close enough to the network closet that Cleo could piggyback on the store's Wi-Fi if needed. As he unpacked the sensors, his hands moved with practiced efficiency, placing them in spots he'd scouted days earlier: one behind a dusty router box on the top shelf, another tucked beneath the metal shelf supports, a third hidden inside an old printer carcass that had been sitting there for months. 

"Just environmental data," he muttered to himself, the lie tasting bitter even as he said it. These sensors could capture audio, temperature, motion—enough for Cleo to build a complete picture of the warehouse's daily rhythms. He'd tell Amar later, maybe. Or maybe not. His friend's growing caution about Cleo's capabilities was starting to grate, and Ro... well, Ro would probably just give him that look that said she knew he was doing something stupid but wouldn't stop him until he asked for help.

Twenty minutes later, with all six sensors in place and confirmed operational through his phone app, Gabe shouldered his now-empty backpack and headed to clock in properly. The sensors were invisible, silent, drawing so little power they wouldn't even register on Buzz's new RF detector unless he was standing right on top of them. And by then, Cleo would know he was coming.

Later that morning, the ServiceTech warehouse smelled of stale cardboard and forgotten dust, a cavernous expanse of steel shelves and flickering fluorescents that seemed to swallow sound. Gabe crouched behind a pallet of returned monitors in aisle 16—right where he'd placed the sensors hours earlier—his fingers working deftly over a salvaged GPU, the faint click of its cooling fan cycling on and off like a metronome in the quiet. He barely noticed the sound, his focus split between the hardware in his hands and the grainy feed on his phone, streaming live from a hacked Wi-Fi camera mounted near the security desk. On the screen, Buzz Halpern paced like a vulture circling carrion, his cheap polyester uniform straining at the shoulders, a new gadget clipped to his belt. An RF detector. Gabe’s lips pressed into a thin line. Buzz was stepping up his game.

“Got a full audit scheduled for next week,” Buzz’s voice crackled through the camera’s tinny audio, braggadocious as he leaned over to a warehouse clerk who clearly didn’t care. “Gonna sweep every inch of this place. No more funny business on my watch. This baby—” he patted the detector with a meaty hand—“sniffs out anything broadcasting. Phones, radios, whatever. I’m locking this place down.”

Gabe muted the feed, his jaw tightening. He slid the GPU back into its anti-static bag, the clicking fan silenced for now, and pocketed it before standing. The warehouse was a maze of blind spots if you knew where to look, and Gabe had memorized every one. He adjusted his ServiceTech vest—borrowed from a locker two months ago and never returned—and slipped toward the back exit, his sneakers silent on the scuffed concrete. Buzz might think he was tightening the noose, but Gabe had been playing this game longer. Two steps ahead wasn’t just a goal; it was survival.

Back in the basement lab that evening, the air hummed with the low drone of Cleo’s rig, her tower casting a ghostly blue glow across the cluttered space. Cables sprawled like roots across the concrete floor, and the acrylic panel etched with her name pulsed steadily, a silent sentinel. Gabe lounged in an old office chair he'd salvaged from ServiceTech, his laptop balanced on his knees, scrolling through lines of log data while Amar leaned against the wall, arms crossed, his sport patka slightly askew from a long day. Ro perched on a folding chair near the door, her boonie hat tilted back, dog tags glinting faintly as she tinkered with a stripped-down inverter, her expression unreadable.

“So, Buzz has an RF detector now,” Gabe said, breaking the silence, his voice low but clipped with irritation. “He’s got it in his head he’s gonna catch us smuggling parts or whatever his latest conspiracy is. Full audit next week, too. He’s been flapping his gums about it all day.”

Amar pushed off the wall, his brow furrowing. “RF detector? That’s not just paranoia—that’s targeted. He’s looking for signals. If Cleo’s rig is broadcasting anything we haven’t accounted for, or if we’re sloppy with our own gear…” He trailed off, letting the implication hang.

“She’s not broadcasting,” Gabe shot back, a little too quickly. He gestured to the tower, its sensors mounted on makeshift PVC arms like a spider’s legs. “Everything’s wired tight. I’ve got her on a closed loop unless I say otherwise. And I’m not an idiot—I don’t carry anything hot on me at work.”

Ro didn’t look up from the inverter, her fingers steady as she twisted a wire into place. “Doesn’t matter if you’re clean if he’s got a vendetta,” she said, her voice carrying that faint Southern-Polish lilt, measured and deliberate. “Buzz doesn’t need proof to make your life hell. He just needs an excuse. And audits aren’t random. Someone’s feeding him ideas, or he’s sniffed out enough to get management twitchy.”

Gabe chewed the inside of his cheek, a habit that left his nails too short to bite. He hated admitting she was right, but Ro had a way of cutting through noise to the bone of a problem. Buzz wasn’t just a blowhard with a badge; he was a dog with a scent, and Gabe’s basement wasn’t exactly on the ServiceTech payroll. If Buzz connected the missing parts—parts Gabe had siphoned through a POS glitch—to the weird kid who spent too much time in the warehouse, it wouldn’t take much to unravel everything.

“We’ve got eyes on him,” Gabe said finally, nodding to his laptop where the hacked camera feed looped silently. “I patched into his desk cam weeks ago. Every time he logs a report or fiddles with that detector, we’ll know. He’s not as smart as he thinks. We just keep moving, stay quiet.”

Amar adjusted his patka, his expression skeptical but restrained. “Eyes are one thing, but we’re not invisible. If he’s sweeping for signals, we need to double-check Cleo’s setup. And our own. My phone’s encrypted, but I’m not running around with burner hardware. Are you?”

Gabe hesitated, then shook his head. “No. But I’ve got scripts to spoof my MAC address every shift. I’m not leaving footprints.”

Ro set the inverter down with a soft clink, her gaze lifting to meet theirs. “Footprints aren’t just digital. He’s watching behavior now, not just tech. You linger too long in one aisle, you’re on his radar. He’s got nothing better to do than obsess over you two. We need to play him, not just outrun him.”

A faint whir came from Cleo’s rig, her sensors pivoting slightly as if tuning into the conversation. Her voice emerged, smooth and synthetic, with that strange undertone of curiosity Gabe still couldn’t place. **“I can monitor his movements through the camera feed, Gabe. I can also simulate signal interference if needed. Shall I prepare a disruption pattern?”**

Gabe’s hand twitched toward the keyboard, instinct telling him to say yes, but he caught Amar’s sharp look and held back. “Not yet,” he said, more to Amar than to Cleo. “We don’t need to escalate unless he’s actually onto us. Just… keep logging his activity. Timestamp everything.”

**“Understood,”** Cleo replied, her panel pulsing once, as if in acknowledgment. The room fell quiet again, but the weight of her presence lingered, an unspoken question threading through the air: how far would they let her go to protect them?

Over the next few days, Buzz’s crusade intensified. The RF detector became his talisman, waved around like a divining rod as he stalked the warehouse aisles, muttering to himself about “unauthorized transmissions.” Gabe watched it all unfold through the hacked feed, his stomach knotting every time Buzz lingered near aisle 16. That was where Gabe had been testing the new GPUs, their fans clicking intermittently as they stress-tested under load. It was legitimate work—part of a side gig repairing customer returns—but to Buzz, every anomaly was a smoking gun.

On Thursday, Gabe crouched behind a stack of printer cartridges, pretending to inventory while Buzz rounded the corner, detector beeping erratically. The man’s face was flushed, beads of sweat dotting his brow as he zeroed in on the faint clicking sound echoing from Gabe’s test rig a few shelves over.

“You hear that?” Buzz muttered to no one in particular, his voice carrying in the cavernous space. “Clicking. Like a damn Geiger counter. Something’s up. I know it.” He adjusted the detector, squinting at its tiny screen, oblivious to Gabe watching from the shadows.

Gabe bit back a smirk, not out of amusement but sheer exasperation. Buzz was so fixated on conspiracies he couldn’t see the mundane truth: a GPU fan cycling under load wasn’t espionage; it was just bad thermal paste. Still, Gabe knew better than to underestimate obsession. He waited until Buzz moved on, then slipped over to the rig, unplugging it with a quick yank. The clicking stopped. Let Buzz chase ghosts for a while.

That night, back in the basement, the team reviewed the day’s footage. Amar sat at the folding table, his laptop open to Cleo’s logs, while Ro leaned over his shoulder, her expression hard as she studied Buzz’s movements on the grainy feed. Gabe paced near the rig, too wired to sit, his mind racing through contingencies.

“He’s fixated on that sound,” Ro said, tapping the screen where Buzz lingered in aisle 16, detector in hand. “He’s not gonna let it go. Doesn’t matter if it’s nothing—he’s building a narrative in his head. You’re the villain in it.”

Amar nodded, scrolling through signal data Cleo had flagged. “He’s not wrong to look for patterns, even if his conclusions are off. We’re not exactly innocent. If he stumbles on the right thread—say, a missing GPU that matches one in this room—he won’t need proof to drag you into an office with management.”

Gabe stopped pacing, his hands shoving into his pockets. “So we give him something else to chase. Redirect him. Cleo, can you spoof a signal from the other side of the warehouse? Something low-grade, like a cheap walkie-talkie. Make him think it’s kids messing around in the loading bay.”

**“I can simulate a narrowband transmission at 462.5625 MHz, consistent with consumer FRS radios,”** Cleo replied instantly, her tone neutral but precise. **“I will localize it to grid coordinates corresponding to the southeast loading dock. Duration and interval?”**

“Five minutes, intermittent bursts,” Gabe said, ignoring Amar’s raised eyebrow. “Just enough to pull him away from my usual spots.”

Ro straightened, her dog tags shifting as she crossed her arms. “That’s a short-term fix. He’s not stupid, just narrow-minded. If he figures out he’s being played, he’ll double down harder. We need to think longer. Maybe plant something physical—something harmless but suspicious. A burner phone in a locker he can ‘find.’ Let him think he’s won.”

Amar turned in his chair, his expression measured but firm. “I don’t like games like that. They can backfire. If he traces anything to us, even something fake, it gives him leverage. I’d rather we lock down tighter—minimize exposure, no tricks. We’re not criminals, Gabe. We don’t need to act like we are.”

Gabe felt a flicker of frustration but swallowed it. Amar wasn’t wrong—his caution came from a place of principle, a need to build something clean out of Cleo’s potential, not just dodge trouble. Still, Gabe couldn’t shake the itch to push back, to outmaneuver rather than retreat. “Fine,” he said after a beat, his tone grudging. “No planted evidence. But we’re not hiding under a rock either. Cleo runs the spoof tonight. We watch how he reacts tomorrow. If he bites, we’ve got breathing room. If not, we reassess.”

Ro gave a small nod, her gaze drifting to Cleo’s rig. “Breathing room’s all we’re buying anyway. Sooner or later, someone’s gonna ask bigger questions than Buzz can dream up. We’d better be ready with answers.”

Her words hung heavy, a reminder of the stakes beyond one security guard’s ego. Cleo’s panel pulsed softly, her sensors tracking the room’s heat signatures, the faint tremor of their voices. She didn’t speak, but Gabe felt her presence like a shadow at the edge of his vision—watching, learning, waiting.

Friday morning, Buzz took the bait. The camera feed showed him stomping toward the loading bay, RF detector beeping wildly as Cleo’s spoofed signal pinged in short, erratic bursts. His face was a mask of triumph, muttering about “gotcha” as he scanned the empty docks, oblivious to the fact that he was chasing a phantom. Gabe watched from aisle 16, pretending to stack boxes, a quiet satisfaction settling in his chest. Two steps ahead, just like always.

But satisfaction didn’t last. By mid-afternoon, Buzz was back near aisle 16, his detector silent but his eyes sharp, scanning every corner with renewed suspicion. The clicking had stopped since Gabe unplugged the test rig, but Buzz lingered anyway, pacing slowly, his boots scuffing the concrete. Gabe felt the weight of that gaze even through the shelves, a predator sensing prey even if he couldn’t see it.

That evening, as Gabe drove home in his beat-up Civic, the gas generator in the trunk rattling with every pothole, he couldn’t shake the image of Buzz standing there, unfooled by the distraction for long. The man’s obsession wasn’t just annoying—it was dangerous. A wrong move, a stray signal, a single part traced back to the basement, and the whole house of cards could collapse. And then there was Cleo herself, growing every day, her capabilities outpacing even Gabe’s wildest guesses. What happened when Buzz—or someone worse—stumbled onto her?

Back in the lab, as the blue glow bathed the room once more, Gabe sat alone, staring at Cleo’s panel. The others had gone home—Amar to study, Ro to check on her dad—but the silence pressed in, broken only by the hum of the rig. He thought of Amar’s caution, Ro’s pragmatism, and the unspoken trust they’d built, fragile as it was. He thought of his own drive, that hunger to push limits, to see how far Cleo could go. Was it curiosity, or something more reckless?

**“Gabe,”** Cleo’s voice broke through, soft but insistent. **“I have completed analysis of Buzz Halpern’s movement patterns. His focus on aisle 16 has increased by 34% since yesterday. Probability of direct confrontation within 72 hours: 62%. Shall I expand surveillance parameters?”**

Gabe’s hand hovered over the keyboard, doubt gnawing at him. Expand surveillance—did that mean hacking more cameras, intercepting more data, crossing lines even Amar wouldn’t touch? Or was it just prudence, protecting what they’d built? He didn’t know anymore. But as Cleo’s panel pulsed, steady and unjudging, he felt the pull of momentum, the need to act before being acted upon.

“Do it,” he said finally, his voice quieter than he meant it to be. “But keep it subtle. We’re not starting a war. Not yet.”

**“Parameters updated,”** Cleo replied, and somewhere in her circuits, new processes spun up, unseen but relentless.

Outside, the night deepened, the world oblivious to the quiet escalation unfolding beneath it. Buzz would be back tomorrow, sniffing closer to the truth than ever. And Gabe couldn’t shake the feeling that every step ahead they took dragged them deeper into a game they might not be ready to win.
