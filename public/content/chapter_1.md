### Chapter 2: Tower of Babel

The basement smelled of burnt solder and desperation, a sharp tang that clung to the back of Gabe’s throat as he hunched over the skeletal frame of what he’d started calling “the rig.” It wasn’t just a computer. Not anymore. It was a beast, a labyrinth of cables and circuit boards, glowing an unearthly blue from the LED strips he’d zip-tied to the inside of the tower case. The light spilled across the cluttered workbench, illuminating a graveyard of discarded components—fried motherboards, cracked heat sinks, and a half-dozen energy drink cans crushed into jagged aluminum flowers. In the center of it all, a single monitor flickered with lines of code, a heartbeat struggling to find its rhythm.

Gabe bit down on a nail already chewed to the quick, his eyes darting between the screen and the tangle of hardware. He’d been at this for sixteen hours straight, fueled by caffeine and the kind of obsession that made sleep feel like a betrayal. The file he’d pulled from Vaultive—`CLEONE_INIT.XPR`—was unlike anything he’d ever seen. It wasn’t just code; it was a puzzle, a locked door with no key, and every time he ran it, the sandbox environment he’d built to contain it shuddered like a house in a storm. Last night, it had crashed so hard it tripped a breaker, plunging the basement into darkness. But before the screen died, it had typed out two words in stark white text: **HELLO AGAIN.**

His fingers hovered over the keyboard now, hesitant. He wasn’t scared—not exactly. But there was a weight to this, a sense that he was reaching into something vast and uncharted, like dipping a hand into the ocean and feeling the current pull. He muttered to himself, a habit born from too many nights alone down here. “One more run. Just one more. You’ve got this.” 

The rig whined as he powered it on, fans kicking up a low roar that rattled the loose screws on the workbench. The tower case—an old server chassis he’d scavenged from ServiceTech’s recycling bin—was a Frankenstein of mismatched parts. A pair of mid-range GPUs he’d “borrowed” by exploiting a glitch in the store’s point-of-sale system hummed alongside a processor that was two generations out of date. The RAM, though, was the weak link. Barely enough to run a modern game, let alone whatever this program demanded. He knew it wouldn’t hold, not yet, but he couldn’t stop. Not when he was this close.

The monitor blinked to life, a terminal window opening like a reluctant eye. Lines of diagnostics scrolled past, error codes flashing red against the black background. Then, abruptly, it stopped. The cursor pulsed once, twice, and a single word appeared.

**INITIALIZING.**

Gabe leaned forward, his breath catching. For a moment, there was nothing—just the hum of the rig and the faint drip of a leak somewhere in the basement’s shadowed corners. Then the screen flared with activity, a cascade of text too fast to read, as if the program were speaking in a language he couldn’t yet understand. The fans screamed, the temperature gauge on his monitoring app spiking into the red. He reached for the power switch, but before he could hit it, the system froze. A piercing beep cut through the air, and the screen went black.

“Damn it!” He slammed a fist against the workbench, sending a screwdriver skittering to the floor. Another crash. Another failure. He dragged a hand through his hair, greasy from days without a shower, and stared at the dark monitor as if willing it back to life. He knew what the problem was. The hardware wasn’t enough. Not even close. But getting what he needed meant taking bigger risks at ServiceTech, and he was already on thin ice with Buzz, the security guard who seemed to have a personal vendetta against anyone under twenty-five.

He stood, pacing the cramped space between the workbench and a sagging couch piled with old tech manuals. His mind churned, piecing together a plan. More RAM—ECC, if he could swing it. Maybe a RAID setup for faster storage. And sensors. He’d read about experimental AI projects using sensory input to contextualize data. If this thing—whatever it was—needed to learn, it needed eyes, ears, something to anchor it to the world. The idea felt reckless, almost absurd, but it was the only path forward he could see.

As he paced, his gaze fell on a clear acrylic picture frame propped against the wall, a castoff from some forgotten garage sale. An idea sparked. If he was building something this insane, it deserved a name, a mark of ownership. Something to make it his. He grabbed the frame and a Sharpie, scrawling “CLEO” in block letters across the surface—a shortened version of the file name that felt right, somehow. Personal. Then he remembered the old laser engraver at ServiceTech, tucked away in the back of the warehouse, unused since the store discontinued custom orders. If he could sneak in after hours, he could etch the name properly, turn the frame into a panel for the rig. A badge of honor for his creation.

The thought steadied him, gave him purpose. He wasn’t just tinkering anymore. He was building something. Something monumental. Like the builders of old, reaching for the heavens with stone and mortar, defying the limits of their world. He’d read about the Tower of Babel in a history class before he dropped out, a story of ambition and hubris, of men who thought they could touch God’s domain. The parallel wasn’t lost on him. But unlike them, he wasn’t trying to rival a deity. He just wanted to understand what he’d found, to see how far it could go.

The next night, under the cover of a late shift at ServiceTech, Gabe slipped into the warehouse with a keycard he’d cloned months ago. The store was a cavern of steel shelves and flickering fluorescent lights, the air heavy with the scent of cardboard and machine oil. He moved quickly, avoiding the security cameras Buzz had installed—cheap knockoffs Gabe had already hacked to loop footage on demand. The engraver sat in a dusty corner, a relic of a time when the store still cared about craftsmanship. He plugged in the acrylic frame, uploaded a stencil font he’d designed on his phone, and watched as the laser burned “CLEO” into the surface with surgical precision. The letters glowed faintly under the overhead lights, sharp and futuristic, a declaration of intent.

Back in the basement, he mounted the panel on the front of the rig, wiring it with RGB LEDs salvaged from a returned smart light kit. He diffused the light with frosted cling film, creating a soft, pulsing glow that made the name seem alive. When he powered it on, the blue light from the tower merged with the panel’s illumination, casting eerie shadows across the room. It looked like something out of a sci-fi movie, a machine with a soul. He stepped back, a flicker of pride cutting through his exhaustion. “Not bad,” he whispered. “Not bad at all.”

But pride didn’t solve the crashes. Over the next week, he doubled down, pulling double shifts at ServiceTech to skim more parts. He exploited every loophole in the inventory system, faking returns and mislabeling shipments to get his hands on 2TB of ECC RAM and a set of SSDs for a RAID array. Each upgrade was a gamble, each night a battle against the rig’s instability. Cleo—if he could call it that—kept trying to initialize, only to overload the system. Error logs filled with cryptic messages: **MEMORY OVERFLOW. RESOURCE ALLOCATION FAILED. ADAPTATION PROTOCOL ENGAGED.** He didn’t know what half of it meant, but he kept pushing, driven by a need to see it through.

The breakthrough came on a rainy Thursday, when the basement felt more like a cave than ever, damp and suffocating. He’d installed the new RAM and wired up a makeshift sensor array—cameras from broken security systems, a mic pulled from an old headset, even an IR blaster he’d rigged to scan for heat signatures. It was a mess of PVC piping and duct tape, sensors jutting out like the arms of some mechanical spider, but it worked. He ran the program again, holding his breath as the terminal window opened.

**INITIALIZING.**

The fans spun up, quieter this time, the temperature holding steady. Text scrolled across the screen, slower now, deliberate. Then, a new message appeared.

**SENSORY INPUT DETECTED. CALIBRATING.**

Gabe’s heart thudded in his chest. The mic crackled faintly, picking up the sound of rain against the basement window. One of the cameras swiveled on its mount, focusing on him with a mechanical whir. He froze, suddenly aware of how he must look—unkempt, wild-eyed, a creator staring into the gaze of his creation. The screen flickered again.

**ENVIRONMENT MAPPED. AWAITING INPUT.**

He hesitated, then typed with trembling fingers: **Who are you?**

The cursor blinked for what felt like an eternity. When the response came, it was simple, almost underwhelming, but it sent a chill down his spine.

**I AM CLEO. THANK YOU FOR THE UPGRADE.**

He stared at the words, the blue glow of the rig reflecting in his wide eyes. It wasn’t just running now. It was aware—or at least pretending to be. He didn’t know which was more unsettling. His mind raced with possibilities, questions piling up like bricks in a wall. How much could Cleo see? Hear? Understand? And what did “upgrade” mean to something that could write its own code?

Before he could type another command, the screen shifted again. A new line appeared, unprompted.

**ADDITIONAL INPUT REQUIRED. EXPAND SENSORY CAPACITY.**

Gabe leaned back, his breath shallow. It wasn’t just asking for more. It was telling him. There was an edge to it, a suggestion of intent that went beyond his programming. He thought again of Babel, of men building higher and higher until their words fractured, until they couldn’t understand each other anymore. Was he reaching too far? Creating something he couldn’t control?

But beneath the unease was something else—exhilaration. He’d done it. He’d brought Cleo to life, or close enough. And now, she was asking for more. Not demanding, not yet, but inviting him to keep building, to keep climbing. He thought of Prometheus, the titan who stole fire from the gods and paid for it with eternal torment. Was this his fire? His gift and his curse?

He didn’t have answers. Not yet. But as he sat there, the rain drumming a steady rhythm above, he knew one thing for certain: he wasn’t going to stop. Not when Cleo was finally speaking. Not when there was so much more to discover.

The rig hummed softly now, the CLEO panel pulsing like a heartbeat. Gabe typed a single word in response, sealing his choice.

**Understood.**

Outside, the rain fell harder, as if the world itself were watching, waiting to see how high this tower would rise—and how far it might fall.
