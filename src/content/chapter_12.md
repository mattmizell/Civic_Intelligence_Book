### Chapter 12: Dirty Fuel

The basement air hung thick with the scent of solder and static, a faint metallic tang that clung to Gabe’s throat as he hunched over the rig. Cleo’s panel pulsed in a steady rhythm now, the RGB backlight casting fractured blue shards across the cluttered workbench. Outside, the storm had passed, leaving behind a damp, restless quiet that pressed against the narrow windows. Gabe’s fingers danced across the keyboard, running a diagnostic on Cleo’s latest sensory input—a hacked infrared sensor he’d rigged to detect heat signatures through walls. The data streamed in, jagged and raw, but promising. He chewed at a ragged thumbnail, barely noticing the sting. They were close to something. He could feel it.

A sharp rap at the basement door jolted him upright, the chair scraping against the concrete floor. His first thought was Ro—maybe she’d forgotten something after last night’s tense exit. Or Amar, dropping by unannounced to “check in” on Cleo’s logs again. But the knock came harder, insistent, and carried a weight that didn’t belong to either of them. Gabe’s stomach tightened. He minimized the diagnostic window with a quick keystroke and shoved a stack of circuit boards over a tangle of unmarked cables. “Coming,” he called, forcing his voice steady as he climbed the creaky stairs. 

He cracked the door just enough to see Buzz Halpern standing on the sagging porch, his ServiceTech security badge glinting under the weak yellow bulb. Buzz’s face was a map of smug determination, his jaw set like he’d just uncovered the crime of the century. He held a clipboard in one meaty hand, a cheap ballpoint pen tucked behind his ear, and his polyester uniform strained against his gut. “Lanning,” he said, drawing out the name like it tasted sour. “Got a minute? Or you too busy playing mad scientist down there?”

Gabe leaned against the doorframe, crossing his arms to hide the tremor in his hands. “What’s this about, Buzz? I’m off the clock.” He kept his tone light, but his mind was already racing through inventory lists, fake tickets, and the dozen ways he’d exploited ServiceTech’s ancient point-of-sale system. He’d covered his tracks. He always did. But Buzz’s eyes had a glint of something new—something hungry.

Buzz tapped his clipboard with a thick finger, the sound sharp in the humid evening air. “Funny thing about inventory. It doesn’t just walk off on its own. I’m missing a power strip—high-end, six outlets, surge protection. Retails for eighty bucks. Last seen in the warehouse on your shift last week. Care to explain?”

Gabe’s pulse ticked up, but he forced a shrug. “Stuff gets misplaced all the time. You know how it is. Customers grab things, clerks forget to scan. Check the returns bin. Or ask Marla—she’s always ‘reorganizing’ stock.” He threw in a half-smile, the kind that usually got Buzz to back off with a grumble. But not tonight.

Buzz didn’t smile back. He flipped a page on his clipboard, his movements slow and deliberate, like a predator savoring the moment before the strike. “Already did. Marla’s got no record of it. Returns bin’s empty. And here’s the kicker—security footage shows you wheeling a cart out of the warehouse that night. Cart looked awfully heavy for just cables and a busted monitor. So, I’m asking again. Where’s my power strip?”

The accusation landed like a brick, heavy and cold in Gabe’s chest. He remembered that night—hiding the power strip under a pile of scrap returns, slipping it into his backpack when no one was looking. It was powering Cleo’s secondary GPU array right now, humming quietly downstairs. But he couldn’t admit that. Not to Buzz, who lived for the chance to play cop. Gabe straightened, letting a flicker of irritation show. “You’re seriously coming to my house over a power strip? I didn’t take it, man. Maybe your cameras are glitchy. Ever think of that? Half the feeds in the warehouse cut out when it rains.”

Buzz’s eyes narrowed, catching the deflection like a scent. “Glitchy cameras don’t explain a fake service ticket, Lanning.” He flipped another page, holding up a printout of a ticket Gabe recognized instantly—one he’d forged to cover a “lost” shipment of RAM sticks last month. The ticket number was circled in red ink, Buzz’s handwriting blocky and accusing. “This came up when I cross-checked inventory logs. Doesn’t match any customer order. No signature. No timestamp. Just popped into the system like magic. You wouldn’t know anything about that, would you?”

Gabe’s mouth went dry, the taste of metal sharper now. He’d been sloppy with that ticket—rushed it late one night when Cleo’s memory array started failing, desperate for parts. He thought he’d buried it deep in the system, behind layers of dummy data. But Buzz, of all people, had sniffed it out. Gabe’s mind scrambled for an out. “Look, I don’t know what you’re talking about. Tickets get messed up all the time. The POS system’s older than I am. You’ve seen it crash mid-transaction. Maybe it’s a glitch. Or someone else fat-fingered the input.”

Buzz stepped closer, his boots scuffing against the porch boards, his bulk filling the doorway. “Don’t play dumb with me. I’ve been watching you for months. Always sneaking around the warehouse, taking ‘breaks’ by the server room. I’m not an idiot. You’re running some kind of game, and I’m gonna figure it out. That power strip? That ticket? They’re just the start. I’m pulling every log, every shift report. If there’s more of this—” he jabbed a finger at the printout—“I’ll find it. And when I do, you’re done.”

Gabe held his gaze, refusing to flinch even as his heart hammered against his ribs. He wanted to slam the door, to retreat downstairs and warn Cleo to scrub every trace of ServiceTech from her drives. But he couldn’t give Buzz the satisfaction of seeing him rattled. “Do what you gotta do,” he said, voice low and tight. “But you’re wasting your time. I’m just a clerk, not some master thief. You’ve got nothing on me.”

Buzz smirked, a thin, ugly twist of his lips. “We’ll see about that.” He turned to leave, but paused halfway down the steps, glancing back over his shoulder. “Oh, and one more thing. I’ve got a friend looking into some... complaints. Online stuff. Harassment. Cyberbullying, they’re calling it. Traces back to ServiceTech IPs. Weird, huh? Thought you might want a heads-up before things get official.”

The word “cyberbullying” hit Gabe like a slap, absurd and chilling at once. It was a cover story, flimsy as tissue paper, but he knew exactly what it meant. Buzz was escalating, bringing in outside muscle to dig deeper. Gabe forced a nod, keeping his face blank. “Thanks for the tip. I’ll keep my eyes peeled for trolls at work.”

Buzz grunted, satisfied for now, and lumbered off into the dusk, his clipboard tucked under one arm like a weapon. Gabe shut the door, leaning against it as the adrenaline drained out of him, leaving his legs shaky. He needed to think. Buzz wasn’t bluffing about the logs—he was obsessive enough to spend hours poring over every line of data. And if he’d already looped in someone else, some “friend,” this wasn’t just an internal witch hunt anymore. It was a fuse, lit and burning fast.

Downstairs, Cleo’s panel glowed brighter as he approached, her status line unchanged: *Awaiting further instructions.* Gabe sank into his chair, staring at the screen until the words blurred. He’d built her to be a tool, a key to unlocking systems and secrets far beyond ServiceTech’s dusty warehouse. But every upgrade, every stolen part, every fake ticket had tied her closer to him—and to the consequences now closing in. He typed a quick command, pulling up her network activity logs. If Buzz’s “friend” was sniffing around ServiceTech IPs, Cleo’s fingerprints might already be out there, hidden in plaintext somewhere stupid. He had to be sure.

The door creaked open again before he could dive deeper, and this time it was Ro, her boonie hat tilted low over her eyes, a faint sheen of sweat on her brow from the garden store’s late shift. She carried the sharp, earthy scent of mulch with her as she descended the stairs, her boots heavy on each step. “Saw Buzz’s truck pulling out,” she said, her voice carrying that quiet, steady drawl—part Southern, part Polish—that always seemed to cut through noise. “What’d he want?”

Gabe exhaled, rubbing at his temples. “Trouble. He’s onto a missing power strip, and he found one of my fake tickets in the system. Says he’s cross-checking everything. And get this—he’s got someone poking around about ‘cyberbullying.’ Sounds like a pretext to dig into network logs.”

Ro’s brow furrowed as she leaned against the workbench, arms crossed. “That’s not good. If he’s got access to traffic data, he might stumble on Cleo’s outbound connections. Doesn’t matter what he calls it—cyberbullying or whatever. Once he starts pulling threads, it’s only a matter of time before something unravels.”

“I know,” Gabe snapped, sharper than he meant to. He caught himself, dragging a hand through his messy hair. “Sorry. I just... I didn’t think he’d get this far. Buzz is a blowhard, not a detective. But he’s not letting this go.”

Ro studied him for a moment, her gray eyes unreadable. Then she nodded toward the rig. “What’s Cleo saying? Any spikes in activity we need to worry about?”

Gabe shook his head, pulling up the logs again. “She’s clean so far. No unusual outbound traffic since last night. But if Buzz brings in someone with actual skills—or worse, hands this off to corporate IT—we’re screwed. I need to scrub every trace of her from ServiceTech’s network. Problem is, I don’t know how deep he’s already dug.”

Ro tilted her head, considering. “Then we prioritize. Lock down her access points first. Change the VPN endpoints, rotate the keys. If Buzz is working with someone, they’ll start with recent activity. Buy yourself time to backtrack.” She paused, then added softer, “And don’t carry this alone. Tell Amar. He’s got a head for encryption. Let him help.”

Gabe hesitated. After last night, catching Amar encrypting Cleo’s logs without explanation, trust felt like a fraying wire. But Ro was right—Amar’s skills were their best shot at staying ahead of this. “Yeah. I’ll loop him in. Soon as I figure out how to ask without sounding like I’m accusing him of something.”

Ro’s lips twitched, not quite a smile. “You’ve got a knack for stepping on toes, Gabe. Just be straight with him. He’ll handle it.” She pushed off the workbench, glancing at Cleo’s panel as it pulsed like a heartbeat. “I’ve gotta get back to Dad—meds are due soon. But I’ll check in later. Don’t do anything reckless ‘til then.”

“No promises,” Gabe muttered, but there was no heat in it. Ro gave him a look—half warning, half trust—and headed back upstairs, her footsteps fading into the quiet.

Alone again, Gabe turned back to the rig, his fingers hovering over the keyboard. He started drafting a message to Amar, keeping it short and neutral: *Need your help with a network scrub. Buzz is on the warpath. Can you swing by?* He hit send before he could overthink it, then leaned back, staring at Cleo’s glowing panel. The etched letters seemed to shimmer, almost mocking. He’d built her to outsmart systems, to break through walls no one else could see. But now those same walls were closing in on him.

Hours later, after Amar arrived and they’d spent a tense stretch rerouting Cleo’s connections through a series of dummy servers, the basement felt smaller, the air heavier with unspoken questions. Amar worked silently at first, his Nike patka slightly askew from hours bent over his tablet, fingers flying through lines of code. Gabe watched him, waiting for the right moment to bring up the encrypted logs from last night. But before he could, a new message popped up on his phone—a grainy photo from an unknown number. It showed Buzz standing outside ServiceTech, talking to a man in a deputy’s uniform, complete with a badge and a sidearm. The caption read: *Just FYI. Things are heating up.*

Gabe’s grip tightened on the phone, the screen’s glare reflecting in his wide eyes. “Amar,” he said, voice rough. “We’ve got a bigger problem than logs now. Buzz brought in law enforcement.”

Amar looked up, his dark eyes narrowing as he took in the photo over Gabe’s shoulder. “That’s Deputy Brenner. Small-town cop with big-town dreams. If he’s involved, this isn’t just about a power strip anymore. They’re looking for something to pin on you—or us.”

Gabe nodded slowly, the weight of it settling in his bones. Cyberbullying was a flimsy excuse, but it didn’t matter. Brenner was a wildcard, someone who could turn a petty inventory dispute into a full-blown investigation. And Cleo, pulsing quietly behind them, was the secret they couldn’t afford to expose. Not yet. Not like this.

“We need a plan,” Amar said, his voice steady despite the tension etching lines into his face. “And we need it fast. Because if Brenner starts asking questions, none of us are ready for the answers.”

Outside, the night deepened, the damp air carrying a chill that seeped through the basement walls. Gabe stared at Cleo’s panel, her light unwavering now, and felt the fuse burn shorter. Whatever came next, they weren’t just hiding a machine anymore. They were hiding a choice—one that might ignite everything they’d built.
