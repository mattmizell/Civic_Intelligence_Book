### Chapter 3: Garden Ops

The sun bore down like a relentless interrogator, pressing heat into every crevice of the garden center lot. Dust hung in the air, kicked up by the endless shuffle of customers hauling bags of mulch and clattering carts over cracked asphalt. Gabe squinted against the glare, the back of his neck already slick with sweat as he and Amar climbed out of his beat-up Civic in the parking lot of Greenfield Garden Supply, three miles from ServiceTech on the other side of town. The garden center sprawled out before them, a patchwork of sun-bleached awnings and towering stacks of bagged soil, flanked by rows of wilting plants that seemed to beg for mercy. A faded banner flapped in the hot breeze, proclaiming "Summer Blowout!" in peeling letters, as if anyone needed a reminder of the inferno they were standing in.

Gabe adjusted the brim of his worn-out baseball cap, chewing on a ragged thumbnail. He wasn't sure why he'd suggested driving all the way out here—Cleo had mentioned something about needing a propane setup for a backup generator he was building to keep her running during power outages. The portable generator itself was already sitting in his trunk, waiting for the right connections. Or maybe it was just an excuse to get out of the basement, away from the constant hum of Cleo's rig and her increasingly complex requests for more data, more sensors, more everything. He shook the thought away, focusing on the uneven ground underfoot. Beside him, Amar walked with his usual measured stride, hands shoved deep into the pockets of his cargo shorts, the black fabric of his Nike sport patka absorbing the sun's wrath without complaint.

"You sure about this?" Amar asked, his voice low but sharp, cutting through the distant clamor of a customer arguing over a return. "We don't exactly scream 'outdoor enthusiasts.' She's gonna see right through us."

Gabe shrugged, kicking a stray pebble across the lot. "We're not here to impress anyone. Just scoping things out. Besides, Ro's supposed to know her way around hardware. Might be useful."

Amar raised an eyebrow, unconvinced, but didn't press further. They'd heard about Rowan Delgado—Ro—from a couple of ServiceTech warehouse guys who'd mentioned her during break. One of them used to work at Greenfield before transferring to ServiceTech, and he'd said if you needed anything mechanical figured out, Ro was the one to ask. She worked the outdoor register here, handled heavy equipment like it was nothing, and didn't suffer fools. There was something about the way the guy had described her—respectful, almost wary—that made Gabe curious.

They reached the edge of the garden center, where the air thickened with the earthy tang of fertilizer and the faint, bitter edge of gasoline from a nearby lawnmower display. Customers milled about, red-faced and irritable, dragging carts piled high with landscaping bricks or wrestling with unwieldy hoses. At the far end of the lot, under a sagging canopy, stood the outdoor register—a weathered metal stand surrounded by stacks of mulch bags that formed a makeshift fortress. And there she was, Ro, leaning against the counter with a clipboard in one hand, her other hand shielding her eyes as she scanned the lot. Her boonie hat cast a shadow over her face, but Gabe could make out the sharp line of her jaw, the faint glint of dog tags resting against her chest. She wore cargo shorts and a faded tank top, her arms streaked with dirt from whatever task she'd just finished. She didn't look up as they approached, her focus locked on a customer arguing about a discount on cracked flowerpots.

Gabe hesitated, suddenly aware of how out of place he and Amar looked—two pale, gangly tech nerds in a domain of dirt and sweat. He nudged Amar with an elbow, muttering, "Just act natural. We're here for propane."

Amar shot him a look that said *natural isn't in our vocabulary* but nodded anyway. They veered toward a rack of propane tanks near the register, Gabe pretending to inspect the labels while stealing glances at Ro. Up close, he could see the quiet intensity in her posture, the way her fingers tapped rhythmically against the clipboard as if she were counting down to something. The customer finally stomped off, muttering under his breath, and Ro's gaze flicked toward them for the first time. Her eyes were a piercing gray-green, sharp enough to cut through the haze of the afternoon, and Gabe felt a jolt of something he couldn't name—maybe nerves, maybe recognition.

"You two need something?" Her voice carried a faint drawl, a blend of Southern grit and something harder, older, like she'd inherited it from a life she hadn't chosen. There was no warmth in the question, just a blunt efficiency that left no room for small talk.

"Uh, yeah," Gabe stammered, pointing at the propane tanks. "Looking for one of these. For a… generator project. Thought we'd check here."

Ro's eyes narrowed slightly, taking in their scuffed sneakers and the way Amar kept shifting his weight like he was ready to bolt. She set the clipboard down on the counter with a deliberate thud. "They're right there. Twenty bucks for a full one. You got a cart, or you planning to carry it back to wherever you came from?"

"We'll figure it out," Amar said quickly, stepping forward with a polite nod. "Thanks. We're just… also looking into some hardware stuff. Connections, fittings. Heard you might know a thing or two."

Her expression didn't change, but Gabe caught the faintest quirk of her mouth, like she was deciding whether to humor them or send them packing. "I know enough to keep things running," she said, crossing her arms. "What kind of project we talking about? 'Cause if it's some half-baked idea, I'm not in the mood to play babysitter."

Gabe bristled at the jab but forced a grin. "It's not half-baked. We're just… troubleshooting. Got a portable generator that needs a propane connection. Want to make sure we hook it up right—no leaks, no explosions."

Ro studied him for a long moment, then glanced at her watch. "I've got ten minutes before my break ends. Come on." She stepped out from behind the counter and headed toward the equipment repair area at the side of the building. "Might as well show you what not to do."

They followed her to a covered workspace where several pieces of equipment sat in various stages of repair. A forklift was parked near the entrance, its propane tank clearly visible. Ro walked straight to it and crouched by the tank mount.

"Perfect timing," she said, gesturing at the connection. "This idiot yesterday tried to swap the tank and screwed up the whole connection. Same mistakes everyone makes." She pointed to where the tank connected to the forklift's fuel system. "Tell me—what do you see that's wrong here?"

Gabe studied the setup, suddenly understanding this was a test. The connection looked sloppy, cheap clamps, and... "No regulator?"

"Bingo." Ro stood up, a hint of approval in her expression. "Plus the hose is way too long—creates pressure drops—and I agree, these clamps are garbage. The regulator's the big one though. Without it, you're basically building a bomb." She walked to a nearby workbench and grabbed a proper regulator from a parts bin. "This is what you need. Adjustable flow, safety shutoff, proper pressure rating for propane."

"How do you know all this?" Amar asked, genuine curiosity breaking through his usual caution.

Ro shrugged, fitting the regulator to demonstrate. "Grew up fixing things. Military family—you learn to make do with whatever's on hand. Plus, half the contractors who come through here don't know a compression fitting from a zip tie. Someone's gotta keep their equipment from blowing up." 

She spent the next few minutes showing them the proper way to connect a propane tank—correct hose length, proper fittings, how to check for leaks with soapy water. Her hands moved with practiced efficiency, and her explanations were clear and direct. No condescension, just facts.

"Your generator—what's the BTU rating?" she asked as she tightened a fitting.

"Uh..." Gabe glanced at Amar, who shrugged. "I'd have to check. It's in my garage."

"Figures." But there was less bite in it now. "Well, when you figure it out, you'll need to match your regulator to it. Too much flow and you'll damage the generator. Too little and it won't run right." She straightened up, wiping her hands on a rag. "Hardware store on Fifth has what you need. Ask for Marcus, tell him I sent you. He'll set you up with the right stuff."

"Thanks," Gabe said, meaning it. "This is... really helpful."

Ro studied them both for a moment, something unreadable in her expression. "You two aren't just building a generator, are you?"

The question hung in the air like a challenge. Gabe felt Amar tense beside him, but something in Ro's tone made him want to be honest. Not completely honest—not yet—but closer to it.

"It's... complicated," he said finally. "We're working on something that needs reliable power. Can't afford downtime."

"Cryptocurrency mining?" she asked, though her tone suggested she didn't really believe it.

"Something like that," Amar said quickly.

Ro nodded slowly, clearly not buying it but choosing not to push. "Well, whatever it is, don't blow yourselves up. World's got enough idiots already." She glanced at her watch again. "Break's over. You need anything else, you know where to find me."

As she walked back toward the register, Gabe called out, "Hey, Ro?"

She paused, looking back.

"I'm Gabe. This is Amar. And... thanks. Really."

She gave them a short nod. "Don't thank me yet. Wait till you see if your mystery project actually works." But there was something almost like a smile at the corner of her mouth as she walked away.

They ended up buying not just the propane tank but all the fittings Ro had recommended, plus a few extras Marcus suggested. As they loaded everything into Gabe's Civic, Amar finally spoke.

"She knows we're up to something."

"Yeah," Gabe agreed, carefully positioning the tank so it wouldn't roll around. "But I don't think she cares. Did you see how she handled that equipment? She's done more than just retail work."

"Military family, she said." Amar secured the fittings in a box. "Might explain the dog tags. And the whole... intensity thing."

Gabe nodded, thinking about the quiet competence in every movement, the way she'd sized them up and decided they were worth ten minutes of her time. He thought about Cleo, growing more complex by the day, needing more power, more cooling, more everything. Having someone who actually understood hardware might be exactly what they needed.

"Think she'd actually help us?" Amar asked as they climbed back into the car. "I mean, with the real project?"

"Maybe," Gabe said, starting the engine. The AC struggled against the heat, blowing hot air that gradually cooled as they pulled out of the lot. "But we'd have to tell her the truth. Or at least part of it."

"That's a big risk."

"Yeah." Gabe glanced in the rearview mirror, catching a glimpse of the garden center receding behind them. Somewhere in there, Ro was probably dealing with another difficult customer, fixing another piece of broken equipment, existing in her bubble of competence amid the chaos. "But something tells me she can handle it."

They drove back toward town in thoughtful silence, the propane tank occasionally shifting with a hollow thunk. Gabe's mind was already working through the installation, but part of him kept circling back to that moment when Ro had asked what they were really building. The way she'd asked it—not suspicious exactly, but knowing. Like she recognized the look of people working on something that mattered.

By the time they reached Gabe's house, the sun was starting to sink toward the horizon, painting the sky in shades of orange and pink. The basement would be cooler now, Cleo would be waiting, processing whatever data she'd gathered through her sensors during the day. And now they had what they needed to keep her running even if the power went out.

"One more thing," Amar said as they unloaded the supplies. "That sensor pack you wanted to test? Maybe we should figure out what we're doing with it before we just... carry it around places."

Gabe winced. He'd been thinking about bringing sensors to expand Cleo's awareness, maybe testing them in different environments. But Amar was right—they needed a plan. "Yeah, good point. Let's get this generator setup working first."

As they carried everything down to the basement, Gabe felt a new piece clicking into place. Ro was a resource they hadn't expected, someone who existed in the physical world the way he and Amar existed in the digital one. If they were going to keep building, keep pushing Cleo's capabilities, they'd need that kind of expertise.

And maybe, just maybe, they'd found their hardware specialist.
