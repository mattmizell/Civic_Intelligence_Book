### Chapter 4: The Patka and the Preacher's Daughter

The sun hung low over the cracked asphalt of the ServiceTech parking lot, casting long shadows that stretched like fingers across the empty space. Amar Singh adjusted the Nike sport patka on his head, the black fabric damp with sweat from the day’s heat, and squinted at the horizon. His hands fidgeted with a small notebook, pages filled with scribbled equations and half-finished code snippets—a habit he couldn’t shake, even now, when the weight of his old ambitions felt like a stone in his chest. He stood near Gabe’s beat-up Civic, waiting for his friend to emerge from the warehouse with whatever contraband part he’d managed to swipe this time. But Amar’s mind wasn’t on Cleo or the rig in Gabe’s basement. It was on a memory: his sister’s laugh, sharp and bright like glass, the last time he’d heard it before the hospital took it away. 

Three miles across town at Greenfield Garden Supply, Rowan Delgado—Ro to anyone who dared get close enough to call her anything—wiped her brow with the back of a gloved hand, leaving a streak of dirt across her forehead. The day had been long, filled with the usual grind of hauling mulch bags and deciphering customer complaints about wilted petunias. Her boonie hat sat crooked on her head, dog tags glinting faintly beneath her worn tank top as she balanced a clipboard against her hip. She glanced at the clock above the outdoor register. Two hours until closing. Two hours until she could drive the twenty minutes to the small, sagging house she shared with her father, where the real work of the day would begin. Her jaw tightened at the thought, but she pushed it down, burying it beneath the steady rhythm of her tasks. There was no room for weakness in a life built on holding things together.

Amar spotted Gabe at last, slipping out the warehouse door with a suspiciously bulky backpack slung over one shoulder. He raised an eyebrow but said nothing as Gabe approached, a faint smirk on his face. “Got it,” Gabe muttered, patting the bag. “Dual-channel ECC RAM. Cleo’s gonna eat this up.”

“Good,” Amar replied, his voice quieter than usual, the lilt of his accent softening the edges of the word. He tucked the notebook into his back pocket, his fingers lingering on the worn cover for a moment too long. “But we need to talk about limits soon. She’s learning faster than we can keep up. I’m not sure we’re ready for what she might do next.”

Gabe’s smirk faltered, but he shrugged it off, popping the Civic’s trunk to stow the bag. “She’s a tool, man. A damn good one. We control her, not the other way around.”

Amar didn’t argue, though a flicker of doubt crossed his dark eyes. He’d seen what unchecked systems could do—how a single missed variable in a medical algorithm could mean the difference between a diagnosis and a death sentence. He’d learned that the hard way, watching his sister Priya fade under fluorescent hospital lights, her breast cancer caught too late despite every test, every scan, every prayer he’d whispered over his textbooks late at night. Back then, he’d been a double major—Pre-Med and Computer Science—at a university that promised him the world. Now, at nineteen, he was a dropout standing in a parking lot, chasing ghosts through lines of code and stolen hardware. Cleo was a chance to build something that mattered, something that could detect patterns human eyes missed. But every step forward with her felt like a step closer to a ledge he couldn’t see.

“You good?” Gabe asked, slamming the trunk shut with more force than necessary. His tone wasn’t soft—Gabe didn’t do soft—but there was a flicker of concern beneath the gruffness.

Amar nodded, forcing a half-smile. “Yeah. Just thinking. Let’s get this back to the lab.”

They climbed into the Civic, the engine sputtering to life with a sound like a dying animal. As they pulled out of the lot, Amar’s gaze drifted to the garden store, thinking about Ro across town at the garden center. She was wrestling a pallet jack loaded with fertilizer bags, her movements precise and unyielding, like a soldier on a mission. He’d only spoken to her once, during that awkward exchange over the propane regulator, but there was something about her—a quiet intensity, a weight she carried without complaint—that stuck with him. He wondered what her story was, what kept someone like her tethered to a place like this.

Miles away, in a neighborhood where the houses leaned against each other like tired old men, Ro pulled into her driveway just as the last light bled from the sky. The house was a patchwork of repairs—siding patched with mismatched panels, a porch that sagged under the weight of memory. She cut the engine of her ancient pickup and sat for a moment, hands still on the wheel, steeling herself for what waited inside. The air smelled of rust and damp earth, a reminder of the steel shed out back where her father held court on Sundays, preaching to a handful of neighbors who still believed in his fire-and-brimstone gospel.

She stepped out, boots crunching on gravel, and pushed open the front door. The living room was dim, lit only by the flicker of a muted TV playing some grainy infomercial. Her father sat in a recliner that had seen better days, his frame gaunt beneath a flannel shirt, his eyes fixed on nothing in particular. A bottle of water sat untouched on the side table—no alcohol, not since he’d found faith after the Gulf War broke him—but the ghosts of those darker years lingered in the lines of his face. His skin was sallow, a side effect of the mysterious ailments the VA called “Gulf War Syndrome” and refused to treat with any consistency. Ro had spent hours on hold with bureaucrats who spoke in circles, filing claims that vanished into a black hole of paperwork, all while her father’s health slipped through her fingers like sand.

“Evenin’, Rowan,” he said, his voice rough, carrying the odd blend of Southern drawl and Polish inflection that marked his speech. A second-generation immigrant from the Midwest, he’d picked up the cadence of the Gulf Coast during his years in the service, commanding a Bradley vehicle in the first wave into Kuwait. Now, at fifty-two, he was a shadow of that man, dependent on his daughter for everything from medication schedules to the small bucket-labeling business he ran from the garage.

“Hey, Dad,” Ro replied, dropping her bag by the door. She moved to the kitchen, pulling leftovers from the fridge with mechanical efficiency. “How’d the day go?”

“Same as ever. Got three orders labeled. Left ‘em by the back door for shippin’.” He paused, coughing into a handkerchief, the sound wet and ragged. “You look wore out, girl. Don’t push yourself too hard.”

She didn’t answer right away, focusing instead on reheating a plate of pierogi and sausage—a recipe from her grandmother that she’d adapted to whatever was cheapest at the store. “I’m fine,” she said finally, setting the plate in front of him with a fork. “Eat. I’ve got some calls to make.”

The calls were always the same: another round with the VA, another plea for updated records or a medication approval that had been “pending” for months. She sat at the kitchen table, phone pressed to her ear, listening to hold music that grated like a dull blade while her father ate in silence. Her eyes drifted to a framed photo on the wall—her mother, smiling in a garden much like the one Ro worked in now, before cancer took her too soon. That loss had brought Ro back from CU Boulder, where she’d been studying archaeology, dreaming of unearthing stories from the earth. Now, her only digging was through red tape, her only relics the dog tags she wore as a reminder of her father’s service—and her own.

When the call finally connected, the voice on the other end was as lifeless as the forms she’d filled out a hundred times. “We’re still processing the claim, Ms. Delgado. You’ll need to submit form 21-4138 again with updated documentation.”

“I submitted it last month,” Ro said, her tone flat but edged with steel. “And the month before that. How long does ‘processing’ take when someone’s barely getting by?”

“I understand your frustration, ma’am, but—”

“No, you don’t,” she cut in, quieter now, but with a force that carried years of exhaustion. “You don’t understand what it’s like to watch someone who fought for this country get treated like a line item on a budget sheet. Send me the form. I’ll do it again. But don’t tell me you understand.”

She hung up before the response could come, her hands trembling slightly as she set the phone down. Her father glanced over, his expression unreadable, but there was a flicker of something—pride, maybe, or guilt—in his pale blue eyes. “You don’t gotta fight all my battles, Rowan,” he said softly.

“Someone has to,” she replied, standing to clear his plate. She didn’t meet his gaze, didn’t want to see the weight of his dependence reflected back at her. Duty was a heavy thing, heavier than the mulch bags she hauled or the pallet jacks she wrestled. It reminded her of something she’d read once in a classics course before she’d dropped out—Hector of Troy, bound by honor to defend his city even as he knew it would cost him everything. Duty over desire, family over freedom. She wondered, not for the first time, if there was a way to carry both without breaking.

Later that night, after her father was settled in bed with his meds sorted for the morning, Ro slipped out to the backyard. The steel shed loomed in the dark, its corrugated walls dented and rusted, a makeshift church where her father preached on Sundays to whoever showed up—usually a handful of old veterans and their wives, clinging to faith in a world that had chewed them up and spat them out. She pushed open the door, the hinges creaking, and stepped inside. The air smelled of oil and sawdust, a lingering trace of the garage projects her father used to tackle before his body betrayed him. A simple wooden podium stood at the far end, flanked by folding chairs scrounged from garage sales. On the wall behind it hung a cross made from scrap metal, welded together by Ro herself during one of her father’s better days.

She ran a hand over the podium, feeling the rough grain of the wood beneath her fingers. Her father’s sermons were raw, unpolished, delivered in that thick Southern-Polish cadence that made every word sound like a command from on high. “The worldly powers are not for us to control,” he’d said last week, his voice trembling with conviction. “Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar’s—but no more.” It was a mantra of resistance, a refusal to bow to systems that had failed him, even as he trusted in a higher authority to guide them through. Ro didn’t share his fire, not exactly—she believed in doing right, in keeping promises, but her faith was quieter, more pragmatic. Still, standing here in the dim glow of a single bulb, she felt the weight of his words settle over her like dust.

Back at Gabe’s house, in the blue-tinged darkness of the basement lab, Amar sat cross-legged on the floor, a laptop balanced on his knees. Cleo’s rig hummed softly in the background, her custom panel—laser-etched with her name in stark stencil font—pulsing with RGB light diffused through frosted film. Gabe was upstairs grabbing energy drinks, leaving Amar alone with the machine that was becoming more than a machine. He typed a command into the terminal, pulling up logs of Cleo’s recent activity. The data scrolled past in green text on a black screen: sensor inputs, audio snippets captured through a hacked mic, even fragments of visual data from a jury-rigged camera Gabe had mounted last week. She was learning, piecing together the world beyond these walls, and Amar couldn’t shake the feeling that they were playing with something far beyond their grasp.

He leaned back, rubbing his eyes, and thought of Priya again. She’d been the one who pushed him to study medicine alongside tech, teasing him about becoming “the family brainiac who saves lives.” He’d wanted to build systems that could catch what doctors missed—patterns in mammograms, anomalies in bloodwork. But when her diagnosis came, no amount of knowledge had been enough. Dropping out hadn’t been a choice; it had been a collapse, a surrender to grief that still clung to him like a second skin. Cleo, though—she could be different. If he could shape her algorithms, guide her growth, maybe he could finish what he’d started. Maybe he could save someone else’s sister, even if he couldn’t save his own.

The basement door creaked open, and Gabe descended with two cans of Monster in hand. “You look like you’re solving world hunger down here,” he said, tossing one to Amar.

“Just checking her logs,” Amar replied, catching the can without looking up. “She’s processing more than we’re feeding her. It’s… unsettling.”

Gabe snorted, cracking open his own drink. “Unsettling’s just another word for progress. Relax. We’ve got this.”

But Amar wasn’t so sure. He thought of something his father had told him once, quoting an old Sikh teaching: *“Recognize the whole human race as one.”* It was a call to unity, to responsibility for others, even when the burden felt impossible. Cleo could be a tool for good—a way to heal, to protect—but only if they wielded her with care. He glanced at the glowing panel again, its light steady now, almost like a heartbeat, and wondered if they were ready for what she might become.

Across town, Ro stood at the edge of her backyard, staring at the shed as the night deepened around her. She pulled out her phone—a stock Google Pixel, chosen for its price more than its features—and scrolled through a text from Gabe about meeting up tomorrow to see “the project.” She hadn’t committed yet, hadn’t decided if she wanted to tie herself to whatever mess these boys were building. But as she looked back at the house, at the faint glow of her father’s window, she felt the familiar ache of being tethered to a life she hadn’t chosen. Cleo, whatever it was, might be a way out—a way to monitor her dad remotely, to step away without abandoning him. Freedom was a dangerous word, one she didn’t dare speak aloud, but it lingered in her mind like a whisper.

She pocketed the phone and turned back toward the house, her boots heavy on the gravel. Tomorrow, she’d decide. Tomorrow, she’d see what Gabe and Amar had built, and whether it was worth the risk. Behind her, the shed stood silent, a monument to faith and struggle, while somewhere deep in Gabe’s basement, Cleo’s sensors whirred softly, waiting for the next piece of the puzzle to fall into place.
