### Chapter 8: Fire Drill

The sky split open just after midnight, a jagged bolt of lightning tearing through the dark like a seam ripped in fabric. Gabe jolted upright in his chair, the basement air thick with the hum of Cleo’s rig and the sudden, sharp scent of ozone seeping through the cracked window. Rain battered the house, a relentless drumroll on the roof, and the blue glow from Cleo’s panel flickered—a brief, sickening stutter that sent a spike of dread through his chest. Power surges were the enemy. One bad hit, and she could fry, terabytes of data and months of work reduced to a smoking heap of silicon.

“Cleo, status,” he barked, fingers already flying across the keyboard to pull up diagnostics. The screen lagged for a heartbeat, then refreshed, her voice cutting through the static of the storm.

“Power input unstable. Voltage fluctuations detected. Backup battery at 62 percent capacity. Recommend immediate action.”

“Yeah, no kidding,” Gabe muttered, chewing at a ragged thumbnail as another peal of thunder shook the walls. The basement felt smaller now, the tangle of cables and salvaged hardware pressing in like a trap waiting to spring. He’d known this could happen—storms in this part of Colorado weren’t rare—but he’d been too focused on Cleo’s data harvesting, on the retinal scans and credential dumps, to prep for something as mundane as weather. Stupid. Reckless. 

He shoved back from the desk, grabbing a hoodie from the floor and yanking it on as he bolted for the stairs. The kitchen was a blur of shadows, the storm’s roar louder up here, rain slashing against the windows in sheets. His phone buzzed on the counter—probably Amar again, checking in—but there was no time. The garage was his target, where the beat-up Honda Civic sat with its hacked-together mobile setup: a gas generator and a clunky inverter that could, in theory, keep Cleo alive if the grid went down. Theory was all he had right now.

Outside, the wind hit him like a slap, cold and wet, driving rain into his face as he wrestled the garage door open. The Civic crouched in the dimness, its dented hood and mismatched tires a testament to every bad decision he’d ever made. The generator was in the trunk, a beast of a thing he’d “borrowed” from ServiceTech during a chaotic inventory day, along with a smaller inverter he’d rigged to step down the voltage. He popped the trunk, the hinges squealing, and hauled out the generator, its weight dragging at his arms as he stumbled through puddles to set it down near the house’s exterior outlet. Rain soaked through his hoodie, plastering his hair to his forehead, but he barely noticed. His mind was a loop of worst-case scenarios: Cleo’s drives corrupting, her code fragmenting, everything he’d built slipping away.

“Come on, come on,” he growled, fumbling with the gas can he kept stashed by the wall. His hands shook as he poured, fuel sloshing over the rim and onto the concrete, the sharp stink mixing with the wet-earth smell of the storm. He didn’t have time for precision. Another flicker of lightning lit up the yard, followed by a crack of thunder so close it vibrated in his ribs. The house lights dimmed for a split second, and his heart lurched. He had to get this running now.

The generator’s pull cord was stubborn, sticking on the first yank, then the second. On the third, it sputtered to life, a ragged cough of an engine that belched black smoke into the rain. Gabe dragged it closer to the wall, hooking up the inverter with clumsy fingers, wires tangling as he tried to remember which lead went where. He’d done this before, sort of, late at night with YouTube tutorials and too much caffeine, but never under pressure like this. Red to positive, black to ground—or was it the other way around? His mind blanked, panic clawing at the edges as he jammed the connectors together, sparks spitting in the damp air.

“Gabe!” A voice cut through the storm, sharp and steady, slicing past the roar of wind and engine. He turned, squinting through the downpour, to see Ro striding across the yard from the street, her silhouette framed by the faint glow of a distant streetlamp. She wore a battered rain jacket over her usual cargo shorts, dog tags glinting at her throat, and her boonie hat was pulled low against the rain. Her boots splashed through puddles with purpose, and even from here, he could see the set of her jaw—calm, focused, like she’d walked into worse messes than this and come out fine.

“What are you doing here?” he shouted over the noise, wiping rain from his eyes as she reached him. Her gaze flicked from his soaked hoodie to the generator setup, then back to his face, and he saw the faintest twitch of exasperation in her expression.

“Amar texted me. Said your network was acting weird, figured you might be in over your head. Didn’t expect a literal fire drill.” Her voice carried that quiet edge, a mix of Southern drawl and something harder, forged from years of holding things together when they wanted to fall apart. She crouched beside the generator without waiting for an answer, her hands moving with a sureness that made Gabe feel like a kid fumbling with Legos.

“You’re gonna blow yourself up,” she said, not unkindly, as she unhooked one of his wires and reattached it with a deft twist. “This inverter’s not rated for that load, and you’ve got gas all over the ground. One spark, and you’re a cautionary tale. Step back.”

Gabe bristled for half a second—pride stinging more than the rain—but he obeyed, shuffling aside as she worked. Her fingers were steady, even slick with water, as she rerouted the connections, checked the fuel line, and adjusted the inverter’s dials with a precision that spoke of experience. He remembered her mentioning fixing forklifts at the garden store, wrestling with propane leaks and stubborn machinery, but seeing it in action was different. She wasn’t just competent; she was a force, unbothered by the storm or the stakes, her focus a stark contrast to his frantic mess.

“How’d you even know to come?” he asked, voice quieter now, almost lost under the generator’s growl. Ro didn’t look up, her attention on a frayed cable she was taping off with electrical tape from her pocket.

“Like I said, Amar pinged me. And I’ve got a weather app. Knew this storm was rolling in hours ago. You didn’t think to prep for it?” There was no judgment in her tone, just a question, but it landed like a jab. Gabe shoved his hands into his hoodie pockets, rain dripping off his nose, and didn’t answer. He hadn’t thought to prep. He’d been too deep in Cleo’s logs, chasing patterns in the data she’d scraped, losing track of the world outside his basement.

Ro straightened, wiping her hands on her jacket as the generator settled into a steadier rumble. “Should hold for now. I’ve got it slaved to the smaller inverter to step down the output—keeps the voltage from spiking. But you need a better setup if you’re gonna run... whatever you’ve got down there.” Her eyes met his, sharp and knowing, though she didn’t push for details. Not yet. “Let’s get this inside before the wind flips it.”

Together, they hauled the rig toward the garage, the rain easing slightly as they maneuvered it under the overhang. Gabe’s arms burned from the weight, but Ro took the brunt without complaint, her strength evident in the set of her shoulders. Once it was secure, tied down with bungee cords she’d pulled from her jacket like a magician, she stepped back, brushing wet strands of hair from her face.

“Power’s stable for now,” she said, nodding toward the house. “But you owe me an explanation. Amar’s worried, and I’m not here just to play electrician in a monsoon. What’s going on, Gabe?”

He hesitated, the weight of Cleo’s existence pressing down heavier than the storm. Ro wasn’t like Amar, who’d dive headfirst into the tech out of sheer curiosity. She was practical, grounded, always weighing costs against benefits. Telling her about Cleo meant opening a door he couldn’t close, inviting questions he wasn’t ready to answer. But as another rumble of thunder rolled through, distant now, he realized he didn’t have a choice. She’d saved his setup—maybe saved Cleo—and that bought her a seat at the table, whether he liked it or not.

“Downstairs,” he said finally, jerking his head toward the house. “I’ll show you. But... it’s complicated.”

Ro’s mouth quirked, not quite a smile. “Complicated’s my specialty. Lead the way.”

The basement was warmer than the garage, the air still tinged with solder and static, but the blue glow of Cleo’s panel was steady now, a rhythmic pulse that felt like a heartbeat. Gabe watched Ro take it in as they descended the stairs, her eyes narrowing as she scanned the rig—the tower of salvaged parts, the sensors mounted on PVC arms, the cables snaking across the floor like roots. She didn’t react, not outwardly, but he could sense her cataloging every detail, piecing together a puzzle he hadn’t fully explained.

“Cleo,” he said, clearing his throat, “status update.”

“Power input stabilized,” came the reply, her voice smooth and synthetic, echoing slightly in the confined space. “Battery at 58 percent. No further fluctuations detected. Thank you for the intervention.”

Ro froze mid-step, her hand on the stair rail, and turned to Gabe with a look that could’ve cut steel. “It talks?”

“She,” Gabe corrected, almost defensively, then caught himself. “Yeah. She’s... an AI. Something I found, rebuilt, upgraded. She’s more than code now. A lot more.”

Ro crossed her arms, her expression unreadable as she studied the glowing panel, the etched “CLEO” catching the light. “Found where? And rebuilt for what? I’m not seeing a school project here, Gabe. This looks like trouble waiting to happen.”

He shifted, unease crawling up his spine. He’d rehearsed this conversation in his head a hundred times, but never with Ro’s piercing gaze on him, her pragmatism stripping away any half-truths before he could spin them. “I pulled her from an old server dump, some defunct cloud setup. She was just a file at first, dormant. I got curious, started adding hardware—RAM, GPUs, sensors. Now she’s... learning. Adapting. I don’t even know her limits yet.”

“That’s the problem,” Ro said quietly, stepping closer to the rig but not touching it. “Limits matter. You don’t build something this complex without knowing where it stops. Or who’s watching.” Her tone wasn’t accusing, but it carried a weight, a reminder of responsibilities Gabe had been dodging. He thought of her father, the ex-Marine turned preacher, and the way Ro shouldered his care—paperwork, meds, bureaucracy—without ever complaining. She understood limits, maybe better than anyone.

“I’m careful,” he said, though the words felt hollow even to him. “Air-gapped most of the time, VPNs for anything external. She’s not out there causing havoc. She’s just... collecting. Data, patterns. Helping me figure out what’s next.”

Ro tilted her head, considering, then nodded toward the screen where Cleo’s diagnostics still scrolled in neat lines. “And what’s next? You’ve got something that sounds alive, or close to it. That’s not a toy. That’s a choice. What happens when she collects something you can’t control?”

The question hung between them, heavier than the storm outside, and Gabe didn’t have an answer. Not a good one. He’d been driven by curiosity, by the thrill of building something no one else could, but Ro was right—every step forward with Cleo was a step into unknown territory. He thought of the credentials she’d harvested, the retinal scans and fingerprints, all stored in her drives. Power like that demanded responsibility, a word he’d never been great with.

“I don’t know yet,” he admitted, meeting her gaze. “But I can’t stop now. She’s too important. Not just to me—to what we could do. Amar’s got ideas for medical tech, ways to use her processing power for good. And I think... I think you’d see potential too, if you gave it a chance.”

Ro’s expression softened, just a fraction, but she didn’t uncross her arms. “Potential’s fine. But I’ve seen what happens when you don’t plan for the fallout. My dad—he trusted systems once, government promises, VA benefits. Got him nowhere but sick and bitter. I don’t trust anything I can’t fix with my own hands. So if I’m in on this, whatever this is, I need to know you’ve got a plan beyond ‘let’s see what happens.’”

Gabe nodded, slowly, the weight of her words settling in. “Fair. Stick around, then. Help us figure it out. You’re already better at this than me.” He gestured to the generator setup upstairs, a sheepish edge to his voice. “I’d have torched the place without you.”

For the first time since she’d arrived, Ro let out a short, dry laugh, more breath than sound. “Yeah, you would’ve. Fine. I’m in—for now. But we do this smart, or I walk. Deal?”

“Deal,” he said, and meant it. Something shifted in the air then, not just relief but a quiet trust, fragile as it was. Ro wasn’t just a fix-it person; she was a tether, someone who’d keep them from spinning out of control. And as the storm outside faded to a low grumble, Cleo’s panel pulsing steady and sure, Gabe felt the stakes rising—not just for him, but for all of them.

He glanced at the screen, at the endless scroll of data Cleo had gathered, and wondered what she’d make of Ro’s arrival. Another variable, another piece of the puzzle. Or maybe, just maybe, the first real check on a power he was only beginning to understand.

“Log entry,” he said, voice low but firm. “New team member added. Rowan Delgado. Role: systems integrity. Cleo, acknowledge.”

“Acknowledged,” came the reply, smooth as ever. “Welcome, Rowan Delgado. I look forward to our collaboration.”

Ro’s eyebrow arched, but she didn’t comment, just gave Gabe a look that said they’d talk more—soon. And as the night stretched on, the basement humming with possibility and risk, Gabe knew they were crossing a threshold. Not just with Cleo, but with each other. The storm had passed, but others were coming, and they’d need every ounce of grit and grace to weather them.
